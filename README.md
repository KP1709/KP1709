## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About me
I'm a final-year computer science student who caught the bug for front-end/web development. Even though I was exposed to web development briefly throughout secondary school and Sixth Form, it took me until university to realise my interest.  

A second-year module (Software Engineering) pushed me to code a basic project using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. After the module finished, I continued to learn front-end development. I've learned about Responsive design and Javascript (including the basics of React). Additionally, I've experimented with tools including Penpot and Font Awesome.  

The technologies and languages I've learned independently and in my undergraduate studies have enabled me to take on a challenge for my dissertation. FastAPI (Python), Jinja2Templating and PostgreSQL are some technologies I have learnt and used in my project.  

After completing my degree, I am eager to pursue a career in the field of web development.  

I am currently learning React Router and SASS but I'm eager to explore other tools and languages in the future such as Vue.js.
