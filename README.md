## 👩🏽‍💻 About me
I'm a frontend developer working in digital healthcare. I caught the bug for front-end development during my computer science degree. Even though I was exposed to web development throughout secondary school and Sixth Form, it took me until university to realise my interest. 

Whilst at university, I had the opportunity to explore various technologies, including Python (FastAPI, Jinja2Templating and data science), C# with .NET MAUI for mobile app development, Supabase and PostgreSQL, to name a few. 

After completing a software engineering module in my second year, I dove into front-end development and continued learning even after graduating. It led me to learn React and Typescript, which I primarily work with. Today I'm continuing to enhance my web development skills.
